# PantryApp
Heyo, If you are looking at this, that means you found my learning project of a pantry app!
I am currently running the #100daysofcode challenge, as well as just trying to learn
software development in general, and I thought this would be a fun app to jump right into.
I definitely saw the idea on reddit some time ago, but I have no idea who it was, so sorry, but thanks for the great idea stranger!
Anyways, I'll be updating this repo everyday until I feel it is complete!
